Website
=======

This repository contains all the information needed for my website. You can find information on everything I've done (including most of the structure of the website) at www.codecademy.com. In particular, their HTML and CSS course is excellent: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web

While I got a lot of good ideas from Codecademy, I did put a lot of work into the site so please contact/credit me if you use anything!
